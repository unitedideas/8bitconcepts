8bitConcepts Launches AI Email Automation Service to Save Small Business Owners 15+ Hours Per Week

WASHOUGAL, WA — February 17, 2026 — 8bitConcepts today announced the launch of its AI Email Automation Setup service, a done-for-you solution that helps small business owners, consultants, and agencies reclaim 15+ hours per week by automating their email management.

The service addresses a critical pain point for entrepreneurs: email overwhelm. According to recent studies, small business owners spend an average of 2-3 hours per day managing email, with many reporting that email is their biggest source of stress and lost productivity.

"I was drowning in my inbox," said Shane Cheek, founder of 8bitConcepts. "847 unread emails. Spending my mornings reacting instead of building. I tried everything—Superhuman, VAs, inbox zero methods. Nothing worked until I built an AI system that handles 80% of my email automatically."

The 8bitConcepts AI Email Automation system includes:

• AI Email Agent: Responds to routine inquiries in 5 minutes, 24/7
• Smart Lead Qualification: Automatically identifies hot prospects vs. tire kickers
• Calendar Integration: Books meetings without back-and-forth scheduling
• Follow-up Sequences: Never lets a lead go cold with strategic automated follow-ups
• Custom Training: AI learns your voice and communication style
• 48-Hour Setup: Fully operational within two business days

"This isn't just about saving time," Cheek continued. "It's about reclaiming your sanity. I went from email being my biggest stressor to barely thinking about it. Now I actually get to focus on high-value work that grows my business."

The service is available now at an introductory founding customer price of $250 (regularly $500) for the first three customers. The one-time fee includes complete setup, training, and 30 days of support.

"At $250, it pays for itself in the first week," Cheek noted. "Most business owners value their time at $100-200 per hour. If this saves you just 2-3 hours per week, that's $800-2400 in monthly value."

The service is particularly valuable for:
• Small business owners receiving 20+ emails per day
• Consultants and agencies struggling to respond to leads quickly enough
• Entrepreneurs spending 2+ hours daily on email management
• Business owners looking to scale without hiring additional staff
• Anyone drowning in repetitive email inquiries

8bitConcepts is offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. If customers don't see immediate time savings and stress reduction, they receive a full refund.

"I'm only taking 3 founding customers at this price," Cheek emphasized. "I want to work closely with early adopters to perfect the system. After that, the price goes to $500 and I'll open it to more people."
