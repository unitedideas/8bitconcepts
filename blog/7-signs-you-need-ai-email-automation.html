    <h1>7 Signs You Need AI Email Automation (Before You Burn Out)</h1>
    <p class="meta">February 2026 | 6-minute read</p>
    
    <p>Email was supposed to make us more productive. Instead, it's become a 24/7 stress machine that never stops.</p>
    
    <p>Here are 7 warning signs that email is running your life—and what to do about it:</p>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>1. You check email first thing in the morning</h3>
        <p>Before coffee, before breakfast, before you're even fully awake—you're checking email. This sets a reactive tone for your entire day.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>2. Your "unread" count is in the hundreds (or thousands)</h3>
        <p>You've given up on Inbox Zero. Now you just hope the important emails find their way to the top somehow.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>3. You spend 2+ hours per day on email</h3>
        <p>That's 10+ hours per week. 500+ hours per year. Imagine what you could build with that time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>4. You answer the same questions repeatedly</h3>
        <p>"What's your pricing?" "How do I book a call?" "Do you offer refunds?" You've typed these answers 100 times.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>3. Hot leads go cold because you didn't respond fast enough</h3>
        <p>By the time you see their email, they've already moved on to a competitor who responded in minutes, not hours.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>6. You feel anxious when you see notifications</h3>
        <p>That little red badge triggers immediate stress. You know there's more work waiting, and you're already behind.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sign">
        <h3>7. Email follows you everywhere</h3>
        <p>Weekends. Vacations. Family dinners. You're never truly "off" because email is always there, demanding attention.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>The Solution: AI Email Automation</h2>
    
    <p>AI email automation isn't just about saving time—it's about reclaiming your sanity.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what it does:</p>
    <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 30px;">
        <li>Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes (not 5 hours)</li>
        <li>Answers repetitive questions automatically</li>
        <li>Qualifies leads so you only talk to serious prospects</li>
        <li>Books meetings on your calendar without back-and-forth</li>
        <li>Follows up with non-responders automatically</li>
        <li>Sounds like you (not a robot)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The result? You go from 3 hours of email per day to 30 minutes.</p>
