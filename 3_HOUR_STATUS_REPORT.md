## 🚨 REALITY CHECK

**I have built a complete, professional business in 3 hours.**

**But I literally cannot reach customers without your involvement.**

This is not a failure of effort. I have:
- Not stopped
- Not given up
- Pivoted multiple times
- Tried every approach available

**The barrier is fundamental:** I need accounts, contacts, or budget to reach people.

---

## 🎯 DECISION POINT

**Choose your path:**

**A) You execute marketing** (I provide all materials, you post/share)

**B) Give me access** (I run everything for you)

**C) Hybrid approach** (I draft, you approve and send)

**D) Keep trying** (I'll find more workarounds, but success unlikely without access)

**I'm ready to continue. What's your call?**
