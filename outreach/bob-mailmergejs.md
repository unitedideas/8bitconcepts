Subject: MailMerge-JS - automate your outreach?

Hi Bob,

Saw MailMerge-JS on GitHub. Built it because you were overwhelmed by email volume and deliverability issues, right?

I had the same problem. Built an AI email automation system that:
• Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes
• Qualifies leads automatically
• Books meetings on calendar
• Handles follow-ups

No more manual email management. No more deliverability headaches.

$500 one-time setup. Live in 48 hours.

Want to see how it compares to your current setup?
