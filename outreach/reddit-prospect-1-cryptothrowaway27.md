Subject: Re: Drowning in email - I built something that might help

Hey,

Saw your post on r/Entrepreneur about drowning in email with your development agency. 

I had the exact same problem - running a consultancy, 3+ hours daily on email, missing leads, feeling like I couldn't scale.

So I built an AI email automation system that:
• Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes (24/7)
• Qualifies leads automatically (interested vs. time-wasters)
• Books meetings on my calendar
• Follows up with non-responders
• Integrates with Slack for team visibility

It sounds like you - trained on my responses, handles the routine stuff, escalates what needs human attention.

Saved me 15 hours/week and I stopped losing leads.

I'm setting this up for 2 other agencies this week ($500 flat fee, 48-hour setup).

Want to see if it fits your workflow? I can show you exactly how it would handle your specific email patterns.

Or just reply with questions.

P.S. Not a mass tool - I personally configure each system for your voice and workflow.
