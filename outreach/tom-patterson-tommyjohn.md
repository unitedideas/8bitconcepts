Subject: Saw your Business Insider feature - I solved my email problem

Hi Tom,

I read the Business Insider article about you drowning in emails at Tommy John. I had the exact same problem running my business.

I tried Superhuman, VAs, everything. Nothing worked until I built an AI email automation system.

It now:
- Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes
- Qualifies leads automatically
- Books meetings on my calendar
- Follows up with non-responders

I'm not drowning anymore. The AI handles 80% of my email.

I documented the system and I'm setting it up for 3 other business owners this month. $500 flat fee, 48-hour setup.

If you're still struggling with email, worth a conversation?
