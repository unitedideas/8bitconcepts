**Subject:** Quick favor + I think you'll find this interesting

Hey [NAME],

Quick ask: Do you know any small business owners who are drowning in email? 

I'm launching an AI email automation service and looking for 3 founding customers. $250 (normally $500). 48-hour setup. Saves 15+ hours per week.

If you know someone who's:
- Spending 2+ hours/day on email
- Missing leads because they can't respond fast enough  
- Wants to scale without hiring a team

I'd love an intro. Or just forward this email to them.

Details: https://8bitconcepts.com/special-offer/

Thanks!
Shane

P.S. Even if you don't know anyone right now, I'd appreciate your feedback on the offer page. What would make you buy (or what stops you)? Hit reply and let me know.

**Headline:** Anyone else spending 2+ hours/day on email?

I was drowning in my inbox. 800+ unread emails. Spending my mornings reacting instead of building.

So I built an AI email automation system. Now:
✅ AI responds to inquiries in 5 minutes
✅ Leads get qualified automatically  
✅ Meetings book themselves on my calendar
✅ Follow-ups happen without me thinking about it

Saved 15+ hours per week. Actually get to focus on high-value work now.

Setting this up for 3 other business owners this month. $250 for founding customers (normally $500). 48-hour setup.
