**Target:** Younger business owners, entrepreneurs, tech-savvy

### Headline
Stop buying AI tools. Start building systems.

### Primary Text
Most businesses are doing AI wrong.

They buy Zapier. Then ChatGPT. Then another CRM. Then a lead scoring tool.

12 different apps.
$800/month in subscriptions.
And they're still doing manual work to connect everything.

Here's the truth:

🔧 Tools force you to adapt to THEM
🏗️ Systems adapt to YOU

We build custom AI systems that:
✓ Fit your exact workflow (not the other way around)
✓ Integrate with your current tools
✓ Are maintained by us (you never touch code)
✓ Start at $497/month (cancel anytime)

40+ businesses have made the switch.

Average savings: $54,000/year.
