## Pitch #1: Productivity/Business Podcasts

---

**Subject:** Guest pitch: How I saved 15 hours/week with AI email automation

Hi [Podcast Host Name],

I just listened to your episode about [specific episode topic]. Great insights on [specific takeaway].

I think I'd be a perfect guest for your audience. Here's why:

**The Story:**
3 months ago, I was drowning in email. 847 unread messages. Spending 3-4 hours per day managing my inbox. Important leads slipping through the cracks.

I tried everything—Superhuman, VAs, Inbox Zero methods. Nothing worked until I built an AI email automation system.

Now AI handles 80% of my email automatically:
• Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes
• Qualifies leads automatically
• Books meetings on my calendar
• Follows up with non-responders

**I went from 3 hours of email per day to 30 minutes.**

**What I can share with your audience:**
- The exact AI tools and setup (no coding required)
- How to train AI to sound like you
- Which emails to automate vs. handle personally
- The ROI: 15+ hours saved per week
- How to implement this in 48 hours

**My background:**
Senior developer with 7+ years building scalable systems. Now helping small business owners reclaim their time through AI automation.

Would this be a good fit for [Podcast Name]? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Shane Cheek

P.S. I can also share the story of launching this as a service and getting my first customers—might be interesting for entrepreneurs in your audience.

## Pitch #2: Tech/AI Podcasts

---

**Subject:** AI email automation that actually works (I built it)

Hi [Host Name],

Big fan of [Podcast Name]. Your episode on [AI topic] really resonated with me.

I built something your audience might find interesting: an AI email automation system that's actually practical for small business owners.

**The Problem:**
Most AI tools are either too complex or too generic. Business owners spend 2-3 hours/day on email but can't afford enterprise solutions or technical teams.

**My Solution:**
A done-for-you AI email setup that:
- Works with existing Gmail/Outlook (no migration)
- Trains on your past emails (sounds like you)
- Handles 80% of routine inquiries automatically
- Qualifies leads and books meetings
- Sets up in 48 hours, not 48 days

**Technical details I can discuss:**
- Which LLMs work best for email (GPT-4 vs Claude vs others)
- How to handle context and thread history
- Privacy and security considerations
- Integration patterns with calendars and CRMs
- Training data requirements and optimization

**Real results:**
- 15+ hours saved per week
- 5-minute average response time
- 3x improvement in lead response rates

Interested in having me on to dive into the technical implementation and real-world results?

Best,
Shane

## Pitch #3: Entrepreneur/Startup Podcasts

**Subject:** From drowning in email to launching an AI service (guest pitch)

Hi [Host Name],

Love what you're building with [Podcast Name]. Your interview with [previous guest] was especially insightful.

I have a story your entrepreneurial audience might appreciate:

**Chapter 1: The Problem**
Running my business while working full-time. Email was eating my life. 847 unread, 3+ hours daily, missing important messages.

**Chapter 2: The Solution**
Built an AI email automation system in my spare time. Started saving 15+ hours per week immediately.

**Chapter 3: The Pivot**
Friends started asking me to set this up for them. Realized there was a business here.

**Chapter 4: The Launch**
Launched 8bitConcepts. $250 per setup. 48-hour delivery. Already serving 3 founding customers.

**What I can share:**
- How to identify a business opportunity from your own pain points
- Building an MVP without quitting your day job
- Pricing and positioning a done-for-you service
- Getting first customers without paid ads
- The tech stack and tools I used

Would this journey be interesting for your listeners?

Best,
Shane Cheek
Founder, 8bitConcepts
