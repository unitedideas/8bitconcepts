Subject: I noticed you're drowning in email - quick question

Hi [Name],

I was browsing [platform/community] and saw your post about struggling with [email volume/customer inquiries].

I had the same problem last month. Spending 3+ hours daily on email, missing leads, feeling like I couldn't scale.

So I built an AI email automation system that:
• Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes (24/7)
• Qualifies leads automatically  
• Books meetings on my calendar
• Follows up with non-responders

It's saving me 15 hours/week and I stopped losing leads.

I'm setting this up for 2 other businesses this week ($500 flat fee, 48-hour setup).

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it fits your business?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How many hours do you spend on email each week?

I ask because I was spending 15+ hours/week on email responses, lead qualification, follow-ups...

Built an AI system that handles it all automatically:
✅ 5-minute response time (vs my previous 8+ hours)
✅ Only qualified leads reach me
✅ Calendar bookings happen without my involvement
✅ Follow-ups go out automatically

$500 one-time setup. 48 hours to go live.

One client in [related industry] saw a 35% increase in booked calls within 2 weeks.

Setting up 2 more this week ($500, 48-hour delivery).

If they say "Tell me more":
"Happy to! Here's the full breakdown: https://8bitconcepts.com/order/

Quick summary:
- $500 one-time
- 48-hour setup
- AI handles responses, qualification, booking, follow-ups
- You only talk to pre-qualified leads

Want to book a 10-min call to see if it's a fit?"

If they say "Too expensive":
"I get it. Here's how to think about the ROI:

If you spend 2 hrs/day on email = 40 hrs/month
At $50/hr value = $2,000/month in time

The $500 pays for itself in the first week.

That said, I do offer a payment plan: $250 now, $250 in 30 days.

Want to move forward?"

If they say "Not right now":
"No worries! Timing is everything.

I'll check back in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I added you to my list for:
- Free AI productivity tips
- Case studies from other businesses
- Early access to new automation tools

Sound good?"

OBJECTION HANDLING:

"Is this spam/too automated?"
→ "The AI is trained on YOUR voice and responses. It sounds like you. Plus you can review every message before it sends (optional)."

"What if it makes mistakes?"
→ "You start in 'review mode' where you approve each response. Once you're comfortable, switch to auto. Plus I fine-tune based on your feedback."

"I don't get that many emails."
→ "Even 10-15 emails/day adds up. The real value is never missing a lead and the follow-up persistence. Most leads convert after 3-5 touches."

"Will this work with my [weird email setup]?"
→ "It works with Gmail, Google Workspace, Outlook, Microsoft 365, Zoho, and any IMAP email. Let's jump on a 10-min call and I'll verify your specific setup."
