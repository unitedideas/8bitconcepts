🚀 LAUNCH: AI Email Automation for Small Business Owners

I was drowning in email. 3+ hours daily. Missing leads.

So I built an AI system that:
✅ Responds to inquiries in 5 minutes (24/7)
✅ Qualifies leads automatically  
✅ Books meetings on my calendar
✅ Follows up with non-responders

$500 one-time setup. 48 hours to go live.

⚡ Only 2 spots this week.

DM me "EMAIL" to grab a spot.

POST 2 (Schedule for tomorrow 9am):

Most small businesses lose 20-30% of leads to slow email response.

AI Email Automation fixes this:
• 5-min response time (vs 8+ hours)
• Qualifies leads before you see them
• Books meetings automatically
• Follows up persistently

$500 setup. Pays for itself in the first week.

Who's manually managing email right now?

POST 3 (Schedule for tomorrow 3pm):

The $500 that saved me 15 hours/week:

Before: Check email 47x/day, respond in 8+ hours, lose leads
After: AI responds in 5 min, I only see qualified prospects

If you're spending 2+ hours/day on email, this is for you.
