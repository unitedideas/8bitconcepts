### Post 2: Value-First
Email management is the #1 time sink for business owners I talk to.

Here's what I learned automating mine:

1. Speed wins - 5-min response beats 8-hour response
2. Qualification is key - filter noise from real opportunities  
3. Persistence pays - 80% of sales happen after 5+ touches
4. Systems scale - you can't hire your way out of email

I built an AI system that handles all four.

First 3 setups: $250 (50% off)

Who's struggling with email?

### r/Entrepreneur (Value post, soft pitch)

I automated my email and got 15 hours back every week.

Here's exactly what I did:

**Before:**
- 3+ hours/day on email
- 8-hour average response time
- Missing leads
- No follow-up system

**After:**
- 30 min/day on email
- 5-minute response time
- Every lead qualified automatically
- Persistent follow-up sequences

**The system:**
1. AI reads and categorizes every email
2. Responds to routine inquiries automatically
3. Qualifies leads (hot vs. cold)
4. Books qualified prospects on calendar
5. Follows up with non-responders (up to 7 times)

**Results after 60 days:**
• 15 hours saved weekly
• 40% more leads converted
• 0 leads lost to slow response
• Actually took a vacation (email kept working)

I'm setting this up for 3 other entrepreneurs this month at cost ($250, covers my time).

If you're drowning in email, might be worth a look.
