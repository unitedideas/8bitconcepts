### Maker Comment
"I built this because I was drowning in email. 3+ hours daily. Missing leads. Feeling like I couldn't scale.

So I created an AI system that handles my entire email workflow. It responds in 5 minutes, qualifies leads, books meetings, and follows up—all while sounding like me.

It saved me 15 hours/week and stopped the lead leakage.

Now I'm setting it up for other small business owners. $500 one-time, live in 48 hours.

Happy to answer any questions!"

### FAQs

A: Yes—Gmail, Google Workspace, Outlook, Microsoft 365, Zoho, and any IMAP email.

**Q: Will it sound like me?**
A: Yes, the AI is trained on your voice and previous responses.

**Q: What if it makes a mistake?**
A: You start in "review mode" where you approve each response. Switch to auto when comfortable.

**Q: Is there a monthly fee?**
A: $500 is one-time setup. You pay for AI usage (~$20-50/month depending on volume).

### Video Script (60 seconds)
"Every small business owner I know has the same problem: drowning in email.

You check it 47 times a day. Spend 2-3 hours responding. And still miss leads because you can't reply fast enough.

I built an AI email automation system that fixes this.

It responds to inquiries in 5 minutes—24/7. Qualifies leads automatically. Books meetings on your calendar. And follows up with non-responders.

The AI is trained in your voice, so it sounds like you wrote it.

I spent $500 setting this up. It saved me 15 hours in the first week.

Now I'm setting it up for other small business owners. Same price: $500 flat fee. Live in 48 hours.

Only 2 spots available this week.
