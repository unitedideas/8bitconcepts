**Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter/X
**Goal:** Awareness, stop the scroll

Your team is drowning in busywork.

Manual data entry.
Copy-pasting between tools.
Following up with leads 3 days later.

Meanwhile, your competitors are using AI to do this stuff in minutes.

We built 40+ custom AI systems for businesses just like yours. 

Average result? $54,000 saved per year.

Not templates. Not chatbots you have to maintain.

100% custom systems. We build 'em, we maintain 'em, you just use 'em.

Cancel anytime. Keep everything.

Sound fair?

## Post 2: The Proof (Results-Focused)
**Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter/X
**Goal:** Credibility, social proof

Real numbers from a real client:

Meridian Financial was spending 30+ hours/week on manual lead follow-up.

We built them an AI system that:
• Qualifies leads automatically
• Sends personalized outreach
• Books meetings on their calendar

Results after 30 days:
✓ 3x more qualified leads
✓ 22 hours saved per week
✓ $8,000/month in labor costs eliminated

ROI hit in 27 days.

That's what happens when you stop duct-taping tools together and actually build something that fits your workflow.

## Post 3: The Take (Contrarian/Opinion)
**Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter/X
**Goal:** Engagement, thought leadership

---

Stop buying AI tools.

Start building AI systems.

Here's the difference:

🔧 Tools = You adapt to them
• Zapier doesn't know your workflow
• ChatGPT doesn't know your customers
• Salesforce doesn't know your process

🏗️ Systems = They adapt to you
• Built around your exact workflow
• Integrated with your actual tools
• Maintained by someone who cares

We see it all the time. Businesses stack 12 different SaaS tools, pay $800/month, and still do manual work to connect them.

Or... they could build one system that does exactly what they need, and pay someone to maintain it.

We know which one scales.

Which approach are you using?

**Goal:** Education, trust-building

"How long does it take to build a custom AI system?"

Most people guess 6 months.

Our average? 2-4 weeks.

Here's how:

Week 1: Discovery
→ We map your workflow, identify automation opportunities, design the architecture

Week 2-3: Build  
→ We develop the system, integrate with your tools, test everything

Week 4: Deploy & Train
→ We launch, train your team, hand over documentation

Then our maintenance kicks in:
→ 24/7 monitoring
→ Bug fixes & optimization  
→ Monthly improvement recommendations
→ Cancel anytime, keep everything

No hiring. No managing developers. No maintenance headaches.

Just a system that works.
