## Email 1: Welcome & The Hook
**Send**: Immediately after signup
**Subject Line**: Welcome — here's what most businesses get wrong about AI
**Preview Text**: The mistake that costs 20+ hours every week

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

Hi there,

Thanks for subscribing. You're now part of a small group of business owners who get practical AI automation insights — no hype, no jargon.

Quick question:

What's the most repetitive task your team does every week?

Data entry? Lead follow-up? Copy-pasting between tools?

Here's what I've learned from building 40+ AI systems:

Most businesses don't need more software.

They need fewer tools that actually talk to each other.

The average small business uses 15+ different apps. Most don't integrate well. So your team becomes the integration layer — manually moving data around, context-switching all day, doing work that software should handle.

It's not your team's fault. It's a tooling problem.

Over the next few emails, I'll show you:
• How to identify automation opportunities (the 80/20 rule)
• Real case studies with actual ROI numbers
• The difference between AI tools and AI systems (most people miss this)

If you want to skip ahead and see what a custom system could look like for your business, book a free 30-minute consultation:

No pitch. Just a conversation about where you're losing time and whether automation makes sense.

Talk soon,

## Email 2: The Case Study
**Send**: 3 days after Email 1
**Subject Line**: How Meridian cut 22 hours/week with one system
**Preview Text**: The before/after most businesses never achieve

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

Hey,

Let me tell you about Jason.

Jason runs operations at Meridian Financial Group. Smart guy, great team, growing business.

But they had a problem: lead follow-up.

Every inbound lead required:
1. Manual data entry into their CRM
2. Research to qualify the lead
3. Personalized email or call
4. Follow-up if no response
5. Logging everything for compliance

Sound familiar?

Jason's team was spending 30+ hours per week on this. Three people, full-time, just following up with leads.

They tried:
• Hiring more SDRs (expensive, hard to retain)
• Buying lead scoring tools (didn't integrate well)
• Using generic automation (too rigid for their process)

Nothing worked. So they called us.

**What we built:**
A custom AI system that:
• Scrapes and qualifies leads automatically
• Sends personalized outreach via email and SMS
• Books qualified leads directly on advisor calendars
• Logs everything for compliance automatically

**The results (measured 90 days post-launch):**
✓ 3x more qualified leads (same lead volume, better conversion)
✓ 22 hours saved per week
✓ $8,000/month in labor costs eliminated
✓ Response time: 4 hours → 4 minutes

Payback period: 27 days.

Here's what Jason told me:

"We were spending 30+ hours a week on manual data entry and follow-ups. 8bitConcepts built us a system in 3 weeks that does it all automatically. Best investment we've made this year."

**The lesson:**

Don't buy tools that force you to adapt.
Build systems that adapt to you.

## Email 3: The Framework
**Send**: 7 days after Email 1 (4 days after Email 2)
**Subject Line**: The 3-question AI readiness test
**Preview Text**: Are you actually ready to automate? (Most aren't)

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

Hi,

Over the past week, I've shared:
• The mistake most businesses make with AI tools
• A real case study with $54K+ in annual savings

Today, I want to give you a framework.

Most businesses ask: "Should we use AI?"

The better question: "Which processes should we automate first?"

Here's the 3-question test I use with every client:

**Question 1: Is this task repetitive?**
→ If you do it the same way more than 5 times per week, it qualifies

**Question 2: Does it follow a pattern?**
→ If a smart person could write down the steps, a system can learn it

**Question 3: Would freeing up this time matter?**
→ If the answer isn't "hell yes," automate something else first

Most businesses have 5-10 processes that pass this test.

Automate the top 3, and you'll save 15-20 hours per week.

**Here's what this looks like in practice:**

| Process | Hours/Week | Automation Potential |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| Lead follow-up | 8 hrs | HIGH |
| Data entry | 6 hrs | HIGH |
| Scheduling | 4 hrs | MEDIUM |
| Report generation | 3 hrs | HIGH |
| Email triage | 5 hrs | MEDIUM |

That's 26 hours. Even if automation only saves you 50%, that's 13 hours back every week.

At $50/hour fully loaded cost, that's $33,800 per year.

For one person.

Now multiply across your team.

**The catch:**

Off-the-shelf tools won't do this. They force you into their workflow.

You need a system built around YOUR workflow.

That's what we do at 8bitConcepts.
