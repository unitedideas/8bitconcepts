## 🎤 Elevator Pitch

"I help small business owners automate their email with AI.

Most entrepreneurs spend 2-3 hours daily on email—responding to inquiries, qualifying leads, booking meetings. It's a huge time sink.

I set up an AI email system that:
• Responds in 5 minutes instead of hours
• Qualifies leads automatically
• Books meetings on your calendar
• Follows up persistently

$500 one-time, live in 48 hours.
