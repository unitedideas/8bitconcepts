# 8bitConcepts

> 8bitConcepts is an AI and automation agency that builds and maintains custom AI systems for businesses. We design, deploy, and manage tailored automation solutions so our clients save time, reduce costs, and scale operations without hiring technical staff.

## About

8bitConcepts specializes in building custom AI automations for small and mid-size businesses. Unlike SaaS tools or templates, every system we build is designed from scratch around the client's exact workflows, tools, and goals. We handle ongoing maintenance through a monthly subscription, so clients never need to manage or update their systems.

Founded by Shane Cheek, 8bitConcepts operates on a build-and-maintain model: clients pay a one-time build fee for their custom AI system, then a monthly subscription (starting at $497/month) for 24/7 monitoring, bug fixes, performance optimization, and workflow updates. Clients can cancel anytime and keep everything that was built.
